# Backc
The Bytecode Compiler for Back   
Back is a Concurrent Forth implementation, have fun

right now, Backc has been almost completed, the only things missing are fixing the `send` and `recv` words, getting a new lexer, and maybe more words

# Building
Backc doesn't need anything fancy, just run :
```shell
ghc backc.hs
```
