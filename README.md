# Backc
The Bytecode Compiler for Back   
Back is Multi-threaded Forth implementation, have fun

right now, Backc has been almost completed, the only things missing are the syntax for isolating different threads, and a global scope for name defintions only, accessed by all the other threads

# Building
Backc doesn't need anything fancy, just run :
```shell
ghc backc.hs
```
